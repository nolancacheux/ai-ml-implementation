# AI & ML Projects

Collection of machine learning and deep learning experiments, notebooks, and utilities.

## Repository structure

- `materials`: reference materials and assorted resources.
- `docs`: documentation and helpful guides.
- `projects`: hands-on work including supervised/unsupervised learning, neural networks, CNNs, and more.

## Highlights

- Classic ML: regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction
- Deep Learning: MLP, CNN, autoencoders
- Popular datasets and practical examples

## Getting started

1. Create a Python environment (e.g., via `venv` or Conda)
2. Install common libraries as needed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`/`pytorch`)
3. Open notebooks in your preferred environment (Jupyter, VS Code, etc.)

Feel free to explore the folders to discover experiments and resources.
