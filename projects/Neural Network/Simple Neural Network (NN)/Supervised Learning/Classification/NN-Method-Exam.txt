NN - Exam Method:

Example with Neural Network Heart Classification

The goal is to write a neural network classifier for this problem, analyzing the data to predict the last column, which contains values of either 0 or 1.

We split the dataset into two parts: even rows for training and odd rows for validation.

Steps:
    1) Load the dataset

    2) Clean the data by removing the first column.

    3) Split the dataset into training and validation sets:

    Even rows for training: data[::2, :] (rows 0, 2, 4, etc.)
    Odd rows for validation: data[1::2, :] (rows 1, 3, 5, etc.)

    4) Describe / Define the model :

        In this case: Binary Classification, with 13 input features and 1 output.

        Neural Network Examples:
            - Regression: Linear activation function.
            - Classification:
                Binary classification: One node with Sigmoid activation (returns a probability between 0 and 1).
                Multiclass classification: Softmax activation (used when predicting multiple categories, e.g., dog, cat, horse in an image).
                Multilabel classification: Sigmoid activation (for independent predictions of multiple labels).
    

    5) Display training and validation history:
        
        Plot the training and validation curves.

    6)Evaluate the accuracy on the validation set.
