### Autoencoder
### Type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning. Autoencoders are designed to learn efficient codings of input data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction or feature extraction.

### Objectives

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce the number of features in the dataset while preserving important information.
- **Feature Learning**: Automatically learn useful features from the input data.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior.

### Components

- **Encoder**: Compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation.
- **Latent Space**: The compressed representation of the input data.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the input data from the lower-dimensional representation.

### Applications

- **Data Compression**: Reducing the size of data for storage and transmission.
- **Denoising**: Removing noise from data.
- **Image Processing**: Enhancing and reconstructing images.
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together based on learned features.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for training.
2. **Model Architecture**: Define the encoder and decoder neural network layers.
3. **Training**: Train the autoencoder on the dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the autoencoder.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize the results, such as the reconstructed data and latent space.
